# CartOls

This is the repo for my current website. It was a pleasure working through it. Its built on a Next.JS , Tailwind, And Vercel stack. Vercel and Next js are such a joy to work with especially the preview websites they provide.

Take a look around its perfect just yet but as I learn more I hope to refine the rough edges.
